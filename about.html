                This website was made for my Capstone Project, a self set challenge worth 70% of my grade.
                I chose 2 concepts, Calisthenics and Coding, because I've wanted to learn about both, and put this forth as an oppurtunity to make myself learn.
                As someone who's lifted for 2 years, calisthenics has always interested, I knew a bit about calisthenics and the ideas and fundamentals behind it but I never found myself practicng it.
                I've done coding in the past through school, mostly rudimentary python and a little bit of web design, but it's been a long time since I directly touched it.
